The Light Box
The purpose of the site is to create an interest in vintage cameras and film photography. The site is geared towards young adults and beginners.

The home page features a few of my favorite vintage cameras and when you click on the camera, it will open a new tab that displays a larger picture of the camera with its information.

The timeline page features cameras through the years in order to give the viewer a sense of how the camera has developed over time.

The gallery page is where I want to feature film photographs taken with vintage cameras by the online community. I would display the photograph along with a picture of the camera that took the shot. For now, the page only has a form for photographers to fill out if they wish to feature their work.

The techniques page features YouTube videos for beginner film photographers.

Design-
I chose to make the design simplistic. The design of the home page is what I'm most proud of. I put a lot of time and effort into creating each picture to look like a polaroid picture. I used trasform and box shadow in css to make it appear that the polaroid pictures were 3D and laid out unevenly.

The bigger issue I encounterd was with the footer. It wanted to show up immediately under the header and it didn't stay put when I resized the screen from desktop to mobile. A minor issue that I never fixed was that I couldn't figure out how to make the camera pictures centered in the new tab.

Something new that I learned from building this website was how to alternate the transform degrees with every other picture on the home page. I also learned how to easily embed a YouTube video on the techniques page.
